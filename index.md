AmirEhsan Khorashadizadeh

I am a last-year Ph.D. student at the University of Basel and a visiting researcher at University College London (UCL). I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Ivan DokmaniÄ‡](https://sada.dmi.unibas.ch/en/people/head-of-sada/ivan-dokmanic) and [Prof. Jason McEwen](http://www.jasonmcewen.org/). Before my Ph.D., I was a master student at Sharif University of Technology.

## Research
My research lies at the intersection of deep learning and computational imaging. I am interested in building deep learning architectures for solving scientific inverse problems. My main focus is on generative models, and neural fields and representation learning.
